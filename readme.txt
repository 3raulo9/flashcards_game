so i'm creating a flash card game

what i want in it is the following:



a page where you can see all the decks


a button that says "create a new deck", and when you press on it you have the following fields:
- name of the deck (text field)

- a select form with languages for a term ( for the tts)
- a select form with languages for the definition of the term ( for the tts)

- a button that says - ADD CARDS

when you click on the deck you can see all the cards:

in each card you can see two speakers:
- the first speaker is for the term, the second one is for the definition.

on each card theres gonna be also a three dotted button that is a select button with the following options:
- Edit, the edit allows to change for that specific card its TTS and the text itself
- Remove, just removes the card

inside the deck there's also the following buttons on the bottom:
- Add a card
- Practice 

The practice mode is gonna consist of only seeing the front and clicking on it makes it turn around and see the back
each side will have a speaker that says the text, and an edit button
on the bottom there's gonna be two buttons that gonna say the following:
- Got it right( takes the card to the right and gives the next card(the screen gets a green hue and a nice jingle plays))
- Got it wrong( takes the card to the left and gives the next card(the screen gets a red hue and a bad jingle plays))

a three dotted button on each deck that has:
- Edit
- add cards
- remove
